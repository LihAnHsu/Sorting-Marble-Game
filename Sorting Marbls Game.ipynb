    "## Sorting Marbles \n",
    "\n",
    "In a particular board game, there is exactly one row and it comprises N spaces, numbered 0 through N - 1 from left to right. There are also N marbles, numbered 0 through N - 1, initially placed in some arbitrary order. After that, there are two moves available that only can be done one at a time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Switch: Switch the marbles in positions 0 and 1.\n",
    "- Rotate: Move the marble in position 0 to position N - 1, and move all other marbles one space to the left (one index lower).\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to arrange the marbles in order, with each marble i in position i.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your class should behave like the following example:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> board = MarblesBoard((3,6,7,4,1,0,8,2,5)) \n",
    ">>> board \n",
    "3 6 7 4 1 0 8 2 5 \n",
    ">>> board.switch() \n",
    ">>> board \n",

    ">>> board \n",
    "7 3 4 1 0 8 2 5 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " Write a second class, **Solver**, that actually plays the MarblesGame\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> board2 = MarblesBoard((1,3,0,2))\n",
